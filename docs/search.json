While tedious, the satisfaction of getting each step to work up until the final product confirmed to me that data science is what I love. Since then, I have not worked with Docker or APIs much as my focus has shifted towards machine learning, making this post a neat refresher for me.\n\n\nSetup\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see Figure 1.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 10 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"

    "text": "Welcome to my data science blog! My name is Nick Kalenichenko, and I recently graduated from the University of Virginia with my Master’s in Data Science. This September, I am excited to embark on my professional journey as a forensic data analyst in Charlotte, NC.\nTo me, data science is the intersection of continuous learning, creativity, and problem solving. In my experience, articulating the process of a data science project reinforces the knowledge learned through the project, enabling a deeper understanding of the material. This is why I have made this website, so I hope you find content you enjoy. Feel free to reach out to me using any of the links up above."
