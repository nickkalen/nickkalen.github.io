Welcome to my data science blog! My name is Nick Kalenichenko, and I recently graduated from the University of Virginia with my Master's in Data Science. This September, I am excited to embark on my professional journey as a forensic data analyst in Charlotte, NC. 

To me, data science is the intersection of continuous learning, creativity, and problem solving. In my experience, articulating the process of a data science project reinforces the knowledge learned through the project, enabling a deeper understanding of the material. This is why I have made this website, so I hope you find content you enjoy. Feel free to reach out to me using any of the links up above.
